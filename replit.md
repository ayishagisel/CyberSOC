## Overview

This is a cybersecurity incident response playbook assistant - a web-based training and simulation tool designed to guide cybersecurity analysts through mock ransomware attack scenarios. The application serves as an MVP for incident response training, featuring an interactive workflow system, role-based views for different stakeholders (Analyst, Manager, Client), and comprehensive logging and reporting capabilities.

The system simulates a realistic cybersecurity environment with mock alerts, endpoint data, security logs, and AI-guided response workflows that follow industry-standard incident response procedures including MITRE ATT&CK framework integration.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React with TypeScript**: Modern SPA built with React 18, using TypeScript for type safety
- **Component Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system for consistent, accessible UI components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom cybersecurity theme colors and dark mode support
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form management

### Backend Architecture  
- **Express.js Server**: RESTful API server with TypeScript support
- **File-based Storage**: JSON files for mock data storage (alerts, endpoints, logs, playbooks)
- **API Structure**: Resource-based endpoints following REST conventions (/api/alerts, /api/endpoints, etc.)
- **Development Setup**: Vite dev server integration with HMR support for full-stack development

### Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL Ready**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with Neon database support
- **Schema Design**: Comprehensive TypeScript schemas using Zod for alerts, endpoints, logs, playbooks, and workflow sessions
- **Mock Data**: JSON files providing realistic cybersecurity incident data for training scenarios

### Key Features Architecture
- **Role-Based Views**: Dynamic UI adaptation based on user role (Analyst/Manager/Client)
- **Workflow Engine**: Step-by-step guided incident response using hardcoded playbook logic
- **Real-time Simulation**: Mock security events and logs with realistic timestamps and data
- **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**: Technique mapping and visualization throughout the incident lifecycle
- **Report Generation**: Automated post-incident reporting with export capabilities

### Component Design Patterns
- **Atomic Design**: Modular component architecture with reusable UI elements
- **Data Fetching**: Custom hooks wrapping TanStack Query for consistent API interactions
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with shared schemas between frontend and backend
